# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter AR Scene ‚Äì Human Computer Interaction

This project is part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course and demonstrates the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in a browser environment using A-Frame and WebXR.

The scene presents a winter-themed environment where a virtual snowman stands on a snowy surface surrounded by several pine trees.
The application detects a horizontal surface (e.g., desk or floor) through the device camera and anchors the 3D models on it.
